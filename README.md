# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

This project includes a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow designed to help users understand the structure, quality, and behavior of the datasets used in the Impostor Detection System. The EDA notebook guides users through a systematic examination of data before model development, ensuring clarity and deeper insight into the dataset.

Objectives of EDA

Provide an initial understanding of data distribution, structure, and completeness

Highlight relationships, correlations, and interactions between features

Detect irregularities, outliers, and potential anomalies

Identify important features that contribute strongly to model performance

Support informed decision-making for preprocessing and modelling

EDA Components

The EDA notebook includes the following steps and analyses:

Environment setup with import checks and optional package installation

Loading of datasets with shape, schema, and preview summaries

Descriptive statistics for numerical and categorical variables

Distribution visualizations including histograms, boxplots, and density plots

Correlation heatmaps and pairwise relationship visualizations

Time-series analysis to track changes and behavior over time

PCA-based dimensionality reduction for structural interpretation

UMAP embeddings for advanced non-linear feature exploration

Isolation Forest anomaly detection to identify unusual behavioral patterns

Feature importance ranking using a Random Forest classifier

Interactive visualizations using Plotly for enhanced exploration

Benefits for First-Time Users

Offers a structured and accessible introduction to the dataset

Helps uncover hidden patterns and potential data quality issues

Provides multiple visual perspectives to understand feature behavior

Highlights feature relevance and data-driven insights

Serves as a strong foundation for further modeling and experimentation

Summary

The EDA process equips users with a solid understanding of the dataset's strengths, weaknesses, and patterns. By combining statistical summaries, visual analysis, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and interactive tools, the notebook ensures a complete and transparent exploration of the data. This preparation is essential for building an effective impostor detection system and supports ongoing research and system refinement.
